The dataset was already scrubbed within following the modules but in order to anaylze different campaigns we will be utilizing the visualizastions prowress and pivot tables within Excel.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Anaylsis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In my first deliverbale, I wanted to look at campaign outcomes based on the launch dates. The outcomes that were being analyzed were "successl", "failed" and "canceled". The best tool for this analysis is using pivot tables. While I could have just insterted a basic table off the regular data, using a pivot table is more rescourful and user friedndly.
