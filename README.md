## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in Campaigns



### Purpose
Due to Lousie's play _Fever goal_ being reached in  a short amount of time, with the data set(xlsx) Louise would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and their funding goal. The dataset was already scrubbed within following the modules but in order to anaylze different campaigns we will be utilizing the visualizastions prowress and pivot tables within Excel.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Anaylsis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In my first deliverbale, I wanted to look at campaign outcomes based on the launch dates. The outcomes that were being analyzed were "successl", "failed" and "canceled" and filtered to only show the Parent Category "theater". The best tool for this analysis is using pivot tables. While I could have just insterted a basic table off the data set and filtered the data it was would have added unneccesary steps. Using a pivot table was the best option. 

The pivot table i created based off the outcomes and parent category, stated before, gave a table with numbers bases off the months of a year. While it is useful table with numbers and it doesn't help because it doesnt tell you what is actually going on. Creating line chart with markers helps to visualize the data set. From the visualization, the outcomes in started of the year with high numbers. While the succesful had higher numbers, which does not come at a suprise, the year just started and projects are hitting the ground running. Campaigns heading into March start to decrease and we hit our first  minimum of our data. Then the campaigns after hitting a low start increasing through May and there we hit our absolute maximum. From May until Sep we start seeing the projects decrease overall. The maximum 166 decreases to 97 in Sep. While see see campaigns start to launch up in Oct, there was actually 0 canceled in Oct.Lastly, to finish the year campaigns are less succesfull where as the failed campaings almost matches the successful.

In May we can see it was a good month for projects out of the total 166 projects 111 were successful!
